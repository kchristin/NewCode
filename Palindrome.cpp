// Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
// An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
// For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.
// so, the soulution is to divide the number in half, if it is even to compare to the other half 
// or get rid of the middle number and following the same procedure if it is odd.
